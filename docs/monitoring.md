# Monitoring & Logging
This document describes how monitoring and logging are handled in the system.

# Logging Strategy
- Application logs are generated using structured logging libraries (Zap or Logrus).
- Logs include request metadata, errors, and response status.
- Logs are written to stdout/stderr and collected by ECS.
- ECS forwards logs to CloudWatch Logs.

# Metrics Collection
- **ECS**: CPU, memory, task health
- **API Gateway**: Request count, latency, error rates
- **Load Balancer**: Connection metrics, target health

# CloudWatch Dashboards
- Visualize system health and performance
- Track error rates, latency, and resource usage

# CloudWatch Alarms
- Configure alarms for:
  - High error rates
  - High latency
  - ECS task failures
- Alarms can trigger notifications via SNS or email

# Best Practices
- Use structured logs for easy querying
- Tag ECS tasks with metadata for filtering
- Monitor inter-service latency if using microservices
